# External blockers and pending gates

Resolved: PHP version decision, Composer installation, baseline reconciliation/testing, portal boot verification, and approval to apply the first three migrations. Existing PHP 7.4.33 is explicitly authorized.

Resolved: the user explicitly approved publication to https://github.com/ReyalSolutions/Spacivo.git. Source is published on main; GitHub Actions runs 37892096783 and 37892501297 passed for c73f304 and e043b77 respectively. PHPMailer commit verification follows.

User selected PHPMailer. The SMTP adapter is implemented and locally tested; private SMTP host, sender and authentication settings plus inbox delivery verification remain outstanding. Local/testing defaults to the private outbox. Production permits only configured SMTP; configuration and MIME tests do not prove actual delivery.

Future Mapbox, payment sandbox, Firebase, hosting and mobile production configuration are not available yet. Those remain later-phase external dependencies, not invented integrations.

Approval audit: automatic review initially rejected applying schema changes to the existing database because authorization was unclear. The user then explicitly approved the baseline and subsequently both Phase 2 migrations/enabling their features. Those exact migrations were applied successfully; this blocker is resolved.
